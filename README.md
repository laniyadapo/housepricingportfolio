The jupyter notebook in this repo is procedural, it contains explanation of all the steps and respective findings with the use of markdowns. This readme will give a summary of the steps and results of the project.

### PROBLEM DEFINITION
Buying a home is easy! I never feel like bursting out in tears! Said no one ever.
Every one needs an enjoyable, happy place where you can live, laugh and learn. This is usually called HOME. Getting the correct evaluation for a house is very important as it is a major investment that is consequential for both the buyers and sellers.

There are various factors that influence the pricing of a house.

The goal of this portfolio is predicting prices for set of houses with reliable accuracy by examining details of features provided in a train data set.

#### Assigned Task
Ask a home buyer to describe their dream house, and they probably won't begin with the height of the basement ceiling or the proximity to an east-west railroad. But this playground competition's dataset proves that much more influences price negotiations than the number of bedrooms or a white-picket fence.

With 79 explanatory variables describing (almost) every aspect of residential homes in Ames, Iowa, this competition challenges you to predict the final price of each home.

#### Supplied Data
- train.csv - the training set
- test.csv - the test set
- data_description.txt - full description of each column, originally prepared by Dean De Cock but lightly edited to match the column names used here

#### Deliverables
- sample_submission.csv - a benchmark submission from a linear regression on year and month of sale, lot square footage, and number of bedrooms

#### Notebook Preparation
- Import Libraries
- Define Classes

### DATA DISCOVERY

#### - Obtain data
1. Load Data 
2. Examine and Get Insights on Data

5. Establish a Baseline
   - Using all the remaining features after data cleaning and exploration, create a baseline for all the algorithm planned to be used in the project. The mean absolute error is the metric utilised.

   Model | Score
   ------------ | -------------
   LassoRegressor | MAE: ~17837
   RandomForestRegressor | MAE: ~15713
   GradientBoostingRegressor | MAE: ~15310
   RidgeRegressor | MAE: ~ 17836
      
   - The next step is to improve the MAE values.
6. Hypothesize solutions
   - Considering the baseline model predictions are based on data provided without extensive feature generation or model tuning we will perform some feature engineering and cross validation to improve the scores before selecting the best model.

     The SalePrice prediction expected output is a continuous value hence we will use from the suite of regression supervised learning algorithms.
   - A suite of regression supervised learning algorithms are selected to improve the MAE metric with the training data.
     - Ridge and Lasso Regression - powerful techniques for creating parsmonious models in the presence of a 'large' number of features.
     - Random Forest Regressor - improves the accuracy by reducing overfitting problem and the variance in decision trees.
     - GradientBoostingRegressor - typically produces best predictions because it can optimize on different loss functions and provides several hyperparameter tuning options that make the function fit very flexible.    

### MODEL DEVELOPMENT

3. Feature Importance
   - Define function
   - Derive feature importance

It is critical that the buyer and seller are happy with the agreed SalePrice of a house.

The predicted SalePrice column in the csv deliverable will be useful for real estate stakeholders.
